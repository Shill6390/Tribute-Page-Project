        <p> <span class="name">Walt Disney</span> was born in 1901. He had four siblings. From a very early age, he loved to draw and create silly characters born from his imagination. His younger brother, Roy, was an early admirer and encouraged him to pursue his dream as cartoonist. While Walt was in high school, he regularly canvased his neighborhood, selling his cartoons to anyone who would buy them. When he was 18, he went to work for the Red Cross and was stationed in France for one year. In addition to medical supplies and equipment, it is rumored his ambulance was plastered with cartoon drawings everywhere he went!</p>
